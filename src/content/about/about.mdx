Portfolio Minimal is a Gatsby Starter that creates your one-page portfolio within minutes!

It has predefined sections for your bio, skills, projects, and contact details. If you are a writer on Medium, you can integrate your latest articles in a distinct section as well. There is a section template included if you want to add more custom sections. 

Using Styled Components, the starter has full theming support, making color and font changes easy.
